## Dynamic Tracking of Shoe Characteristics

This dynamic report intends to analyse the characteristics of different shoes I saw. The nature of my data is observational. During the observation period, every time I left my house, I would note down 3 characteristics about the first pair of shoes other I saw someone wearing. Two of these are categorical variables; the shoe brand and what type of shoe it was. The other variable was numeric, which was how many colours were on the shoe.
