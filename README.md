# stats220
## Introduction

* *This is my repo for STATS 220.* 

### A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in commerce and communications. [Commerce and Communications Conjoint](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/new-programmes/bachelor-of-communication-commerce.html)
- I am taking STATS 220 because it looked the most intersting and useful out of my required stats courses
- I am interested in learning about coding in general
